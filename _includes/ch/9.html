  <h2 id='chapter-9'>9. Working with lists</h2>

  <p>
    In this chapter, we'll cover some functions that Elixir has helpfully got built-in to the language to help us work
    with lists.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just like there is a <code>String</code> module for working with strings, there is also a <code>List</code> module
    for working with lists. This module includes functions like <code>first</code> that will tell you what the first
    item in a list is:
  </p>

  <pre><code>List.first([1, 2, 3, 4])
<span class='console-yellow'>1</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    And it also lets you figure out what the last item is too:
  </p>

  <pre><code>List.last([1, 2, 3, 4])
<span class='console-yellow'>4</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    We looked earlier at how we could reverse a string, but how about if we wanted to reverse something else, like this
    list?
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> animals_or_derivatives_of_animals = ["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    We would think that just like <code>first</code> and <code>last</code> that there should be a <code>reverse</code>
    too! We might think this because Elixir provides us a way to reverse strings -- with <code>String.reverse("string")</code> --
    so why not lists too? Let's try it out:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
<span class='console-red'>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function List.reverse/1 is undefined or private
    (elixir) List.reverse(["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"])</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    Uh oh, there's that red text again. It seems like that this function doesn't exist, even though we thought it did.
    We are lacking the superpower of being able to will functions into being at this current point in time, so we'll
    have to do some sleuthing to figure out why it's missing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The computer is telling us that Elixir doesn't know about a function called <code>List.reverse</code>, or the
    function is "<em>private</em>". The computer (slyly) won't tell us which one of non-existence or privateness it is,
    but we'll assume the first case here: that the function is undefined. (We'll come back to private functions a little
    later on in the book.)
  </p>

  <aside>
    <header>Izzy asks: "Hey, what's that <code>/1</code> after the function?"</header>

    <p>
      Glad you asked! It's indicating the <em>arity</em> of the function. We saw the word <em>arity</em> back in Chapter
      5, and to refresh your memory, arity is another way of saying "the number of arguments".
    </p>

    <p>
      Elixir functions can not only differ by <em>name</em> but also by the number of arguments that the function takes.
      This error message is telling us that we tried to call the <code>List.reverse/1</code> function. It's showing the
      <code>/1</code> at the end because we only passed one argument. If we passed two arguments instead of one it would
      tell us that we tried to call the <code>List.reverse/2</code> function instead.
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals, [1, 2, 3])
List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals, [1, 2, 3])
<span class='console-red'>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function List.reverse/2 is undefined or private
    (elixir) List.reverse(["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"], [1, 2, 3])</span></code></pre>

    <p>A good example of this is the <code>String.split</code> function that we saw earlier. It has two variants, one
      that takes a single argument (<code>String.split/1</code>) and one that takes two arguments
      (<code>String.split/2</code>). We only saw the single-argument version before:</p>

    <pre><code>iex> String.split("Hello, World!")
[<span class='console-green'>"Hello,"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"World!"</span>]</code></pre>

    <p>
      However, if we supply a second argument to this function it behaves differently:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> String.split("Hello, World!", "o")
["Hell", ", W", "rld!"]</code></pre>

    <p>
      The function name doesn't change, but the number of arguments changes, and that alters how the function behaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second argument to <code>String.split/2</code> tells the computer where to split the string. With the single
      argument version, the computer assumed we wanted to split on the spaces between the words. With the two argument
      version &mdash; that is, the <code>/2</code> version &mdash; we tell it that we want to split on the
      <code>"o"</code> character instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point it's also worth mentioning that the <code>String.upcase</code> function we used back in the last
      chapter has a proper name of <code>String.upcase/1</code>. Just like <code>/2</code> indicates the function takes
      two arguments, the <code>/1</code> here indicates that this function takes one argument. When referring to Elixir
      functions, make sure to include the arity as well as the function's name.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an important distinction to make in Elixir, and so I'll say it again, this time a bit bigger:
    </p>

    <p style='font-size: 150%; text-align: center;'><strong>Functions not only differ by name, but also by the number of
        arguments that they take.</strong></p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    Ok, so we've talked about what <code>/1</code> means (Izzy is now deep in thought), so let's talk about why
    <code>List.reverse/1</code> doesn't exist.
  </p>

  <h3>Thank you Reader, but our <s>princess</s> function is in another <s>castle</s> module</h3>

  <p>
    The short version of why the <code>List.reverse/1</code> function doesn't exist is because it lives in a separate
    module; it exists in the <code>Enum</code> module. The name <code>Enum</code> is short for <code>Enumerable</code>,
    and it's done that way because nobody has the time to write out <code>Enumerable</code> correctly every single time.
    Even as this book's author I have a hard time spelling it correctly each time! Thank goodness for autocomplete.
  </p>

  <p>
    "What on earth is an enumerable?", Izzy cries out. Hold your horses, Izzy. We're getting to that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lists are a type of data in Elixir called an <em>enumerable</em>. Maps are also <em>enumerables</em>. This means
    that they can be <em>enumerated</em> through; which means that you can do something with each item in the enumerable
    object (a list or a map). For instance, if we were to write out our list on a piece of paper, it might look
    something like this:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Cow</li>
    <li>Turducken</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It's possible to write each item from the list separately from the other items in the list. Because we're able to do
    this we can safely say that this list is <em>enumerable</em>. We could try to do the same thing for a number (like
    1,354), but it wouldn't make sense:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>3</li>
    <li>5</li>
    <li>4</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Numbers are not enumerable because it doesn't make sense for them to be written like this, unlike our list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similar to this, we could <em>enumerate</em> through a map. If we were to take one of our maps from earlier...
  </p>

  <pre><code>%{name: "Izzy", age: "30ish", pronouns: "she/her"}</code></pre>

  <p>
    ...and write each key and value pair down, they may look something like this:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt>
    <dd>Izzy</dd>
    <dt><strong>Age</strong></dt>
    <dd>30ish</dd>
    <dt><strong>pronouns</strong></dt>
    <dd>she/her</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    Again, it makes sense for a map to be an enumerable because you can <em>enumerate</em> through each of the key and
    value pairs in the map.
  </p>

  <h4>And now for the big reveal</h4>

  <p>
    We need to keep in mind that when we're working with <em>enumerable</em> things in Elixir the function that we need
    might live elsewhere. While there is most certainly a <code>List</code> and a <code>Map</code> module (which we'll
    see in <a href='/10-maps'>the next chapter</a>) -- sometimes, we need to look in the <code>Enum</code> module too
    for the function we want.
  </p>

  <p>
    We tried looking in the <code>List</code> module to find the <code>reverse/1</code> function so that we could turn
    our list around but it wasn't there. We found out a short while ago that the function is actually within the
    <code>Enum</code> module, so let's try using that function. Before that, let's get our list in Elixir form again.
    It's been a while since we've seen it that way:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> animals_or_derivatives_of_animals = ["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    Since we now know that lists are <em>enumerables</em>, and that the <code>List.reverse/1</code> function doesn't
    exist <em>but</em> we also (now) know that there's an <code>Enum</code> module to work with this sort of thing, we
    can probably guess that there's going to be an <code>Enum.reverse/1</code> function. Let's try it and see:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> Enum.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
  [<span class='console-green'>"turducken"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"cow"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"dog"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"cat"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>
    Hooray! We were able to reverse our list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Izzy's features relax from intense concentration to a more neutral setting and she asks, "Hey, you mentioned before
    you could <em>enumerate</em> through a list or a map, but you didn't show an example of that. What gives?" You're
    absolutely right, Izzy. I was too distracted with explaining why <code>List.reverse/1</code> didn't exist to explain
    how to enumerate through an enumerable. I'm glad that <em>someone</em> is paying attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's all now take a look at how to do that before we move onto other functions. We've talked about enumerables
    briefly and it would be a shame to stop so early when you can do so much more with them than reverse them.
  </p>


  <a id='enumerating-enumerables'></a>
  <h3>Enumerating the enumerables</h3>

  <p>
    To appease Izzy (and the masses that she leads) yet again, we're going to need to look at how to enumerate through
    enumerables. What this means is that we're going to get an enumerable (a list or a map) and we're going to go
    through each of the enumerable's items and do something with them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start with a list. How about a list of the world's top five most liveable cities, just for something
    different?
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> cities = ["vienna", "melbourne", "osaka", "calgary", "sydney"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    The simplest way of enumerating through a list in Elixir is to use the <code>Enum.each/2</code> function. Remember
    that the <code>/2</code> here means that the function takes two arguments. Those two arguments are:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The thing we want to enumerate over; and</li>
    <li>a function to run for each of the items.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at an example:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> Enum.each(cities, &amp;IO.puts/1)</code></pre>

  <p>
    The first argument here is our list of cities. The second argument is the function that we want to run for each item
    in this list: specifically the built-in <code>IO.puts/1</code> function. The <code>&amp;</code> before this function
    name is referred to as the "capture operator". We saw this back in Chapter 5, but we were using it to build our own
    functions then:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> greeting = &("Hello #{&1}")</code></pre>

  <p>
    The <code>&amp;</code> has another use, and that is to capture functions from modules so that we can use them later.
    In this example, we're capturing <code>IO.puts/1</code> so that <code>Enum.each/2</code> can call that function on
    each of the items in the <code>cities</code> list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at what this combination of <code>Enum.each</code>, <code>cities</code> and
    <code>&amp;IO.puts/1</code> does:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> Enum.each(cities, &amp;IO.puts/1)
vienna
melbourne
osaka
calgary
sydney
:ok</code></pre>

  <p>
    This particular combination of those three things has made Elixir output each city on a single line in our
    <code>iex</code> prompt. Then there's one more thing: that little blue <code>:ok</code> at the end of our output.
    That's a little atom value and it indicates to us that the iterating with <code>Enum.each/2</code> worked
    successfully. We saw atoms like this used for keys in maps in previous chapters, but they can also be used in Elixir
    code like this too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's take a closer look at what this <code>Enum.each/2</code> code is doing. Specifically: what
    <code>&amp;IO.puts/1</code> is doing. You know in Elixir that functions can take arguments and you might have in
    your head that those arguments could be strings, lists or maps because this is what we've seen done previously. But
    function arguments can also be other functions. This is what's happening here when we're using
    <code>&amp;IO.puts/1</code>. We're passing that function as an argument to <code>Enum.each/2</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get an idea of how <code>Enum.each/2</code> is able to take the <code>IO.puts/1</code> function and do something
    with it, we can use this code in the <code>iex</code> prompt:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> puts = &amp;IO.puts/1
puts.("melbourne")
"melbourne"
:ok
</code></pre>

  <p>
    With this code, we've assigned the <code>IO.puts/1</code> function to a variable called <code>puts</code>. This is
    similar to what's going on inside the <code>Enum.each/2</code> function: whatever function we pass as the second
    argument will be stored with a particular name. Then <code>Enum.each/2</code> goes through each of the items and
    calls the provided function on it, just like we've done above.
  </p>



  <aside>
    <header>Try this one as a program too</header>

    <p>
      You should try running the above example as an Elixir script too. Save this file at <code>cities.exs</code> and
      run it with <code>elixir cities.exs</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What you'll see will mostly be the same: all the cities are output on their own lines. What you won't see is that
      final <code>:ok</code>. This is because when we run a function in the <code>iex</code> prompt, the function will
      always tell us what its result is.
    </p>

    <p>
      However when we get to the "big time" of running an actual program, Elixir will only generate output once we tell
      it to; with something such as <code>IO.puts/1</code>. This is why when you run this script you're <em>not</em>
      going to see <code>:ok</code>.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    "That last line looks exactly like how we ran functions back in Chapter 5", Izzy exclaims. Yes, Izzy! That is
    exactly right. Back in that chapter we defined a <code>greeting</code> function like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> greeting = fn (place) -> "Hello, #{place}!" end
<span class='console-yellow'>#Function&lt;6.52032458/1 in :erl_eval.expr/5&gt;</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    We then made Elixir run this function using this syntax:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> greeting.("World")
<span class='console-green'>"Hello, World!"</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    What we're doing different here with our <code>puts = &amp;IO.puts/1</code> is that we're using an inbuilt function
    rather than constructing one of our own. We can do this with any inbuilt function we please. Here's another example,
    using <code>String.capitalize/1</code>:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> cap = &amp;String.capitalize/1
cap.("melbourne")
<span class='console-green'>"Melbourne"</span>
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Here, the <code>String.capitalize/1</code> function takes a string and turns the first letter into a capital letter.
    In this code example, we're making it so that we can call the <code>String.capitalize/1</code> as if it were a
    function called <code>cap</code>. However, if we wanted to capitalise the names of our city using the
    <code>String.capitalize/1</code> function with <code>Enum.each/2</code> it wouldn't do very much:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> Enum.each(cities, &amp;String.capitalize/1)
<span class='console-blue'>:ok</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    Nothing is output here besides <code>:ok</code> because we're not telling Elixir to output anything. It will
    dutifully run the function <code>String.capitalize/1</code> for each item in the list, and then just as dutifully
    "forget" to tell us anything about the result.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we want to see what the result would be from evaluating <code>String.capitalize/1</code> for each item in the
    list, we're going to have to use a different function.
  </p>

  <h4>Map, but not the kind that you know already</h4>

  <p>
    The names of these cities should be capitalized because they are proper nouns, but whoever created this list
    neglected to capitalize them. Oops! What we should have is a list with proper capitalization:
  </p>

  <pre><code>["Vienna", "Melbourne", "Osaka", "Calgary", "Sydney"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    We tried using <code>Enum.each/2</code> to give us this list of capitalized cities, but that just told us
    <code>:ok</code> and it didn't give us back a list of capitalized city names.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're going to need a function that goes through each item in the list and applies <code>String.capitalize/1</code>,
    and then shows us the result of each application of that function. Something that would turn our existing
    <code>cities</code> list into a list like this one:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> cities = [
    String.capitalize("vienna"),
    String.capitalize("melbourne"),
    String.capitalize("osaka"),
    String.capitalize("calgary"),
    String.capitalize("sydney"),
  ]
[<span class='console-green'>"Vienna"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Melbourne"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Osaka"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Calgary"</span>,<span class='console-green'>"Sydney"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>
    But since we've already got a list we're going to have to do <em>something</em> to that list to turn it into what we
    want. That something is to use another function from the <code>Enum</code> module called <code>Enum.map/2</code>.
    This <code>map</code> function is different from the map kind of data (<code>%{name: "Izzy"}</code>), in that the
    function-called-map will take the specified enumerable and another function as arguments, then enumerate through
    each item in the list and run that other function for each item, and then return the result of each function run.
  </p>

  <p>
    Enough jibber-jabber. Let's see this in actual practice:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> Enum.map(cities, &amp;String.capitalize/1)
[<span class='console-green'>"Vienna"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Melbourne"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Osaka"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Calgary"</span>,<span class='console-green'>"Sydney"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>
    Hooray! Each of our cities now has a correctly capitalized name. What's happened here is that we've told the
    <code>map</code> function that we want it to run another function &mdash; that'd be the
    <code>String.capitalize/1</code> function &mdash; on each item of the <code>cities</code> list. This is how we've
    been able to go from our existing list with non-capitalized city names to a new list with capitalized names.
  </p>

  <aside>
    <header>But why is it called "map"?</header>

    <p>
      Truth be told, I didn't really give the name "map" much thought before I wrote this section of this book. I've
      always known it to be "map", but never really thought about why. I wanted to answer it right here, but I didn't
      know myself and <a href='https://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/892334810416402433'>so I asked about why it's called
        map on Twitter</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The consensus from the Twitter hivemind (nestmind? flockmind?) seems to be that this is a math-y term which gets
      its meaning from the cartographer map &mdash; wherein the dimensions of the Earth are represented graphically on a
      map. When you resize one part of the map, you have to resize all the other parts by making the same
      transformation, otherwise the map no longer makes sense. I found that kind of fascinating, to be quite honest.
    </p>

    <p>
      In math, the term "map" means to take a set of numbers and then to apply the same function across them to
      transform them into a new set of numbers. Hey, that's like what we're doing here &mdash; except we've got a set of
      words, and not numbers. We're taking a list of strings and then transforming them into a new list of strings.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <h4>BYO functions</h4>

  <p>
    One more quick example. When using <code>Enum.each/2</code> or <code>Enum.map/2</code> we don't necessarily need to
    pass a built-in function as the second argument. We could choose to pass our own function instead. Let's say that we
    had a list of numbers like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]</code></pre>

  <p>
    And then we wanted to multiply each number by a different number, let's say 2. We're lazy and we want the computer
    to do the heavy lifting, and so we can pass <code>Enum.map/2</code> a function of our own design to achieve this
    goal:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex&gt; Enum.map(numbers, fn (number) -&gt; number * 2 end)
[8, 16, 30, 32, 46, 84]</code></pre>

  <p>
    With our own function here, we're taking each element of the list &mdash; represented inside the function as the
    variable <code>number</code> &mdash; and then multiplying it by 2. When <code>Enum.map/2</code> has finished going
    through the list, it outputs a new list showing us the result of running that function on all items in the list.
  </p>

  <h4>Reducing an enumerable</h4>

  <p>
    We've now looked at how to use two functions from <code>Enum</code>, <code>each/2</code> and <code>map/2</code>.
    These are two of the most commonly used functions from this module, and that's why we looked at them. But there's a
    third function that I'd like to tell you about too: <code>Enum.reduce/2</code>. It's a very helpful function!
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>Enum.reduce/2</code> allows us to iterate through a list and gradually apply a function to each element in
    that list to get a final value. Think of it like when you're cooking: you're <em>reducing</em> all the ingredients
    into a meal. You don't think of a spaghetti bolognese as it being a combination of onion, garlic, beef mince,
    tomatoes, herbs and spaghetti. You think of it as a complete meal. When we want to combine values in Elixir to
    produce one final value, we would use <code>Enum.reduce/2</code>. Let's take a look at it now.
  </p>

  <p>
    We might want Elixir to tell us what the average of a list of numbers is. For instance, we might want to calculate
    the average of some scores, say for a test. Hey look, here are some handy score numbers now (out of 100):
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> scores = [74, 79, 89, 32, 79, 70, 32, 69, 76, 73, 88, 73, 82, 31]</code></pre>

  <p>
    I wanted to keep writing numbers above but 14 numbers just felt right for some reason. It looks like most people in
    this test did particularly well. Good on them! A few didn't do so great and only scored 32 and one scored 31.
    Anyway, let's not look too closely at the data. What we're trying to do is to calculate the average for these scores
    and to do that we might try to sum these numbers up ourselves on a piece of paper
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src='/9-lists/images/reduce-sum.png'>
    <figcaption>Figure 9.1: Adding together numbers manually</figcaption>
  </figure>

  Or we might try using a calculator instead, as that's less error-prone. The way that we would do this calculation on a
  calculator is exactly as above: we would add each number up, one at a time, to calculate the sum. Our input into the
  calculator would be this:
  </p>

  <pre><code>74 + 79 + 89 + 32 + 79 + 70 + 32 + 69 + 76 + 73 + 88 + 73 + 82 + 31</code></pre>

  <p>
    The calculator would then tell us that the sum of these numbers is <code>947</code>, as our on-paper working out
    should've shown us too. Go ahead and check this in your <code>iex</code> console too if you'd like; after all, it's
    just a super-powered calculator.

    Once we have the sum, then we need to divide that sum by the amount of numbers that we summed in order to get the
    average. Here, we have 14 numbers. So the average is <code>947 / 14</code>, which a calculator or the
    <code>iex</code> prompt should both tell you: <code>67.64285714285714</code>. The calculator may not have as many
    decimal places. If we wanted to write this whole operation in Elixir code, it would be very simple:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> (74 + 79 + 89 + 32 + 79 + 70 + 32 + 69 + 76 + 73 + 88 + 73 + 82 + 31) / 14</code></pre>

  <p>
    We sum up all the numbers, then divide it by how many scores we had. Easy! It's easy here because there are only 14
    numbers. But what if we had scores from hundreds of people? We wouldn't want to enter all this into our calculator
    or the <code>iex</code> prompt, now would we? "No way!", contributes Izzy. Exactly! So let's look at how we could
    use <code>Enum.reduce/2</code> to do the summing up for us, to save us having to work it out all ourselves.
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> scores = [74, 79, 89, 32, 79, 70, 32, 69, 76, 73, 88, 73, 82, 31]
[74, 79, 89, 32, 79, 70, 32, 69, 76, 73, 88, 73, 82, 31]
iex> Enum.reduce(scores, fn (score, sum) -> sum + score end)</code></pre>

  <p>
    The <code>reduce/2</code> function here does exactly the same calculations as our earlier prompt: it returns 947. It
    does this by taking the first number, then it adds the second, third, forth and so on to get the sum. How does it do
    this? Well, let's walk through what this function is doing.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, we pass <code>reduce/2</code> the list of scores that we want to sum up. Then we pass it another function
    which takes two arguments: <code>score</code> and <code>sum</code>. Inside this function, we add these two arguments
    together. But what values do <code>score</code> and <code>sum</code> have inside this function? One easy way to
    figure that out is to get Elixir to output their values every time this function inside <code>reduce/2</code> is
    used:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> Enum.reduce(scores, fn (score, sum) ->
  IO.puts(sum)
  IO.puts(score)
  IO.puts("---")
  sum + score
end)</code></pre>

  <p>
    Even though the order of the arguments inside the function are <code>score</code> and <code>sum</code>, we're
    outputting them here as <code>sum</code> and <code>score</code> for reasons that will become clear soon. When we run
    this new variant of our <code>reduce/2</code> function, this will be the output:
  </p>

  <pre><code>74
79
---
153
89
---
242
32
---
274
79
---
353
70
---
423
32
---
455
69
---
524
76
---
600
73
---
673
88
---
761
73
---
834
82
---
916
31
---
947</code></pre>

  <p>
    The first number that we're outputting is the <code>sum</code> and the second number is the <code>score</code>. If
    we look at the first four lines of our output we'll see three numbers: 74, 79 and 153.
  </p>

  <pre><code>74
79
---
153</code></pre>

  <p>
    If we look back at our <code>scores</code> list definition, we can see that its first two numbers are 74 and 79.
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> scores = [74, 79, ...]</code></pre>

  <p>
    So then where does 153 come from? The answer is easy: <code>74 + 79 = 153</code>. So we can tell from the output
    here that our <code>reduce/2</code> function is taking the first item from our list and making that the initial
    <code>sum</code> argument for our inner function. The second item then becomes the <code>score</code> argument. In
    the function, we're adding these two values together, and that results in 153. The <code>reduce/2</code> function
    keeps going through the remaining numbers in the list, adding them one-at-a-time until we get the final result.
  </p>

  <p>
    So that's the wonderful <code>reduce/2</code> function, or at least one example of it. As you can see, it's very
    handy for when we want to combine (or <em>reduce</em>) several items into one item.

  <h3>Summing up a list</h3>

  <p>
    It's at this point that I should probably mention one more function in the <code>Enum</code> toolbox called
    <code>sum/1</code>. This function takes a list and sums up all the items in it, just like our <code>reduce/2</code>
    function. These two functions are identical in how they work:
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> scores = [74, 79, 89, 32, 79, 70, 32, 69, 76, 73, 88, 73, 82, 31]
[74, 79, 89, 32, 79, 70, 32, 69, 76, 73, 88, 73, 82, 31]
iex> Enum.sum(scores)
947
iex> Enum.reduce(scores, fn (score, sum) -> sum + score end)
947</code></pre>

  <p>
    So if you're wanting to sum up a list of numbers, it's better to use <code>Enum.sum/1</code>, than to use to
    <code>Enum.reduce/2</code>, just because it's less code. If you want to do another operation other than summing,
    like subtraction, multiplication, division and so on, then it's better to use <code>Enum.reduce/2</code>.
