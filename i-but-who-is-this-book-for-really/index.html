    On the opening page you might've seen this:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Joy of Elixir is a gentle introduction to programming, aimed at people who already know some things about computers, but who have little-to-no programming experience. If you think you don't know enough about computers, well you got here already and that's enough!
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Or you might've just gone straight to the "read it online" link and missed that. Anyway, now that I have your attention and you've read that little paragraph you might be thinking: but who is this book for, really? Well, let me lay it out plain and simple like:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>This book is for anyone who has ever wanted to learn to program.</em> You might've attempted it before. You might not have. You might've read some very <em>dry</em> books on programming and been turned off it, but now you're back here. I'm glad you're still with us. Thanks for giving us all another shot.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the extent of your programming experience is using functions like <code>SUM(A1:A23)</code> in Microsoft Excel to sum up all the numbers in a few rows, then that's fine. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then that's fine too.
  </p>

  <p>
    The extent of your programming knowledge might just be telling the computer to always put a signature at the end of your emails. Something official looking with your name, job title and phone number. There might even be a pithy quote at the end. Yes, even that is programming. You've given the computer an instruction and it's dutifully carrying it out until told otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    You're reading this book on a computer device of some description and that's a perfect start. You probably know what a web browser is. You have some idea that programming lets you boss the computer around and cut down on the repetitiveness of some computer-based tasks. That's brilliant.
